`configure` will probe the system for dependencies.  On a Fedora 32
system, I had to install the following packages:

```
dnf install protobuf-c-compiler
dnf install protobuf-c-devel
dnf install libXScrnSaver-devel
```

Using the follwing commands to find the packages:

```
dnf provides protoc-c
dnf provides "*/protobuf-c/protobuf-c.h"
dnf provides "*/extensions/scrnsaver.h"
```
