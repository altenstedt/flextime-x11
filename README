# What is this?

This directory holds Flextime, a program for tracking working hours.

The Flextime daemon query X11 for the time since the last user input
once every minute and stores the result on disk.  The flextime program
can be used to display the times the user has been active on the
computer.  For example:

    $ flextime
    20200810 07:16:50 — 16:10:22  8:53 | 0:27 w/33 Monday
    20200811 13:29:45 — 14:01:18  0:31 | 0:12 w/33 Tuesday
    20200812 07:33:21 — 17:22:56  9:49 | 6:22 w/33 Wednesday
    20200813 07:54:32 — 15:17:12  7:22 | 3:34 w/33 Thursday
    20200814 07:29:37 — 10:38:36  3:08 | 3:08 w/33 Friday

If your working day starts and ends on the computer, this list
effectively represents your working hours.

Just make sure that the Flextime daemon, flextimed, is started every
time you log in.

# Building

`configure` will probe the system for dependencies.  On a Fedora 32
system, I had to install the following packages:

```
dnf install protobuf-c-compiler
dnf install protobuf-c-devel
dnf install libXScrnSaver-devel
```

Using the follwing commands to find the packages:

```
dnf provides protoc-c
dnf provides "*/protobuf-c/protobuf-c.h"
dnf provides "*/extensions/scrnsaver.h"
```

I do not think that there are any runtime dependencies, except for
X11.  I do not know how this relates to Wayland (I am apparently
running X11).

# Running the daemon

If you are running a Gnome shell, you can use a desktop file in your
~/.config/autostart/ folder to start the Flextime daemon every time
you log in.  For example:

```
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=Flextime Daemon
Exec=flextimed
Terminal=false
```

To see logs from the daemon you can use the `journalctl` command:

```
journalctl -r _COMM=flextimed
```

# Create a release

```
git checkout <tag>
make clean dist
# upload tgz to Github release
cp flextime-<version>.tar.gz ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/
cp rpmbuild/flextime.spec ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/
cd ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/
rpmlint
rpmbuild -ba flextime.spec
```
