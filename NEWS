# 0.17.3

Fix a set of issues where the daemon would hang and stop working.

# 0.17.2

Fix potential buffer overflow

# 0.17.1

Fix build warnings

# 0.17

Fix an issue where running the print command would not properly
display the latest data.  (You had to run the "flextime" command twice
to be sure that you got all the data.)

# 0.16

Add specification file for building an RPM package for Fedora.  The
build process is updated to make it more robust.

The folder that holds the data that the flextime generates is now
created with more restricted access rights (0750).

# 0.15

The daemon process starts as a proper daemon so that flextimed can be
easily started as part of your login shell.

The print command renders usable output, including date, week number,
total time and work time.

Start and stop measurement kinds are written so that we no longer miss
the first and last minute.
